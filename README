This is an external controller for a Blackmagic Design Micro Cinema Camera (BMCC).

It uses the S.Bus port to control the functions of the camera.
Ultimately it will be a remote with the following functions:
- wireless control of multiple cameras
- SMPTE timecode for syncronization through the audio port on the BMCC
- frame-accurate synchronization using tri-level sync through the BMMCC Sync port
